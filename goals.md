We'll need to work with arrays for each week

We will have 3 kinds of shift
  E = early
  L = late
  O = off

At first maybe would be better to work with functions and arrays, and then pass them inside classes

First we need the shift generator, and after the filter to improve the shifts, which probably would be in 2 clases
