# Early considerations

* We'll need to work with arrays for each week

* We will have 3 kinds of shift
  - E = early
  - L = late
  - O = off

* First we need the shift generator, and after the filter to improve the shifts, which probably would be in 2 clases


# Shift generator

In the end starting to work with a class was easier since I had already part done from my world_generator project.

# TL shift pattern
